## üõ† Common Technologies

All projects use:
- **React 18.3.1+** - UI library
- **TypeScript 5.6.2** - Type safety
- **Vite** - Build tool and development server
- **ESLint** - Code linting

## üì¶ Project-Specific Technologies

- **React Router DOM** - Client-side routing (rotas, carrinho, criptoapp, devlink, webcarros)
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first CSS framework (carrinho, devlink, webcarros)
- **Firebase** - Backend services (devlink, webcarros)
- **Axios** - HTTP client (carrinho)
- **React Hook Form + Zod** - Form handling and validation (webcarros)
- **Shadcn UI** - UI component library (webcarros)

## üöÄ Running the Projects

Each project follows a similar structure:

```bash
# Navigate to project directory
cd <project-name>

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Preview production build
npm run preview
```

## üìÅ Project Structure

Each project typically contains:
- `src/` - Source code
- `public/` - Static assets
- `package.json` - Dependencies and scripts
- `tsconfig.json` - TypeScript configuration
- `vite.config.ts` - Vite configuration
- `README.md` - Project-specific documentation (if available)

## üéØ Learning Path

The projects are organized to progressively teach:
1. Basic React and TypeScript concepts
2. State management (useState, Context API)
3. Routing and navigation
4. API integration
5. Authentication and protected routes
6. File uploads and cloud storage
7. Complex form handling and validation
8. Full-stack application architecture

## üìù Notes

- Most projects include their own README files with specific documentation
- The `webcarros` project is the most comprehensive, demonstrating advanced React patterns
- Firebase projects require proper configuration before running
- All projects use modern React patterns and TypeScript best practices
